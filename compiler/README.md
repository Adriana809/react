# React Compiler

React Compiler is a compiler that optimizes React applications, ensuring that only the minimal parts of components and hooks will re-render when state changes. The compiler also validates that components and hooks follow the [Rules of React](https://react.dev/reference/rules).

More information about the design and architecture of the compiler are covered in the [Design Goals](./docs/DESIGN_GOALS.md).

More information about developing the compiler itself is covered in the [Development Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).
